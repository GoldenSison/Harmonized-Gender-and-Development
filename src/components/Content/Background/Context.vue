      <h2>CONTEXTS OF THE GUIDELINES</h2>
      <hr class="my-3">
      <p>RA 7192 provides the legal mandate for  involving women in development (see sidebar). An  additional mandate comes from the Philippine Plan  for Gender Responsive Development (PPGD), which  envisions a society that promotes gender equality and  women's empowerment and upholds human rights, among other development goals. It also commits the Philippine government to addressing issues of  poverty, violence against women and other abuses of  women's human rights, and the continuing invisibility of women in public affairs (see box 1).  </p>
      <p>
          Another document, the Framework Plan for  Women focuses on women's economic empowerment,  the protection and fulfillment of women's human  rights, and the promotion of gender-responsive  governance. The Philippine government has adopted  gender mainstreaming as its principal strategy for  pursuing these goals.  
      </p>
      <p>
          Development assistance from individual  donors in the Philippines is governed by the PPGD  and donor policies and strategies. The latter are  shaped by national priorities of donor countries or  policies of governing boards of multilateral aid  agencies, as well as by international agreements.  These agreements include the Beijing Platform for  Action, the final document of the United Nations  (UN) Fourth Conference on Women in 1995; the UN  Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which  provides a framework within which a range of issues may be addressed based on a core understanding  of nondiscrimination and equality; and donor commitments to Organisation for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) policies contained in the 1998 DAC Guidelines on Gender Equality and  Women's Empowerment in Development Co-operation. The twin goals of gender equality and women's  empowerment articulated in the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) gender guidelines  are echoed in most of the GAD policy statements and guidelines of the major bilateral and multilateral  ODA partners of the Philippines. The core requirements of the harmonized GAD guidelines apply to  development programs and projects, although their application may slightly vary according to the  funding focus and priorities of the donors.
