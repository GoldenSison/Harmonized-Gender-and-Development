        <hr>
        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:50px;">In 1993 the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)
            and the
            National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (PCW), now known as the Philippine Commission on Women
            (PCW), in
            conjunction with various Philippine government agencies, produced <i>the Guidelines for Developing and
                Implementing
                Gender-Responsive Programs and Projects.</i> The document sought to assist line or implementing agencies
            in (1)
            complying with Republic Act (RA) No. 7192, known as the Women in Development and Nation-Building Act, and
            its
            Implementing Rules and Regulations; (2) integrating a gender and development (GAD) perspective in
            development
            planning processes and various stages of the project cycle; and (3) addressing the issues of inadequate
            sex-disaggregated data and statistics for development planning and programming.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:50px;">Since the mid-1990s, most official development assistance (ODA)
            donors
            have also crafted their own GAD guidelines to assist their officers, contractors, and local partners
            incorporating
            GAD concerns in the design and implementation of their programs and projects. By early 2003, or ten years
            after the
            Philippine government issued its GAD guidelines, Philippine government agencies had been contending with
            often
            overlapping GAD checklists.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:50px;">In mid-2003, NEDA and the Official Development Assistance
            Gender and
            Development Network (ODA-GAD Network) agreed to harmonize GAD requirements after reviewing the existing
            checklists
            for project development, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E). This initiative aimed to
            produce a
            common set of guidelines for the Philippine government agencies and donors while allowing variations in
            priorities
            among them.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent:50px;">The new GAD guidelines reflect the evaluation of assistance
            framework
            from Women in Development (WID) to GAD and the current focus on women’s rights. The current version of the
            guidelines also incorporates the suggestions of many groups in the Philippine government that have tried the
            original set of guidelines.</p>

        <h2 id="objectives">OBJECTIVES AND CONTENTS</h2>
        <hr>

        <p>The harmonized GAD guidelines seek to promote the twin goals of gender equality and women’s empowerment.
            Specifically, these aim to:
        </p>
        <ol style="text-align:justify;">
            <li>Provide NEDA, ODA donors, Philippine government agencies, and development practitioners with a common set of
                analytical concepts and tools for integrating gender concerns into development programs and projects and</li>
            <li>Help achieve gender equality in, and empower women through, projects and programs.</li>
        </ol>
