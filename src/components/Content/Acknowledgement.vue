            . . . the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace
            require
            the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields.
        </q>
        <p>
            The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW),
            often described as the international bill of rights for women, was ratified by 177 countries
            including the Philippines. By accepting the Convention, states commit themselves to undertaking
            a series of measures to end discrimination against women in all forms, including the
            incorporation of the principle of equality of men and women in their legal system, abolition of all
            discriminatory laws, and adoption of appropriate ones prohibiting discrimination against women.
            As in other human rights instruments, the CEDAW defines gender equality as a human rights
            concern.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the Philippines signed the Millennium Declaration, which includes the
            promotion of gender equality as its third goal. The target of eliminating gender disparity in
            primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and all levels of education not later than
            2015, is projected to be reached or even surpassed by the Philippines. Gender equality is integral
            to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Without progress toward
            gender equality and women’s empowerment, none of the MDGs and their targets will be
            achieved.
        </p>

        <p>
            Being a signatory to CEDAW, the Philippines has made the Convention a part of the law of
            the land. It is also one of few countries with gender equality provisions in its Constitution.
            Section 14 of Article II states that “it recognizes the role of women in nation-building, and shall
            ensure the fundamental equality before the law of women and men.” Other noteworthy laws and
            policies promoting gender equality are the Women in Development and Nation -Building Act
            (Republic Act [RA] 7192), the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development (PPGD),
            the Anti-Sexual Harassment Act (RA 7877), the Anti -Trafficking in Persons Act (RA 9208), the
            Anti-Violence against Women and their Children Act (RA 9262), and laws on Rape (RA 8353
            and RA 8505).
        </p>
        <p>
            For women’s rights advocates in government and nongovernment organizations as well as
            national and local government leaders who adhere to these commitments, the gender and
            development (GAD) approach is a necessity. It has been proven that any effort toward
            sustainable development requires the participation of women at all levels of policymaking and
            policy implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Philippines has been taking concrete steps toward integrating GAD concerns in the
            development process. The Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines is a vital
            contribution to this process of gender mainstreaming. This document is a product of a
            multisectoral process on the required processes and mechanisms for the Philippine Plan for
            Gender-Responsive Development as part of our efforts to implement RA 7192, and its
            Implementing Rules and Regulations; guide the integration of the GAD perspective in
            development planning processes and various stages of the project cycle; and address the issues of
            inadequate sex-disaggregated data and statistics for development planning and programming.

        </p>
        <p>
            We, the international development partners in the Philippines, are happy to collaborate with
            the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and the Philippine Commission on
            Women (PCW) in producing these guidelines. Working together, and with the assistance of a
            gender expert, we worked out a set of guidelines that harmonizes all our existing guidelines
            (donors and government). We hope this will redound to a shared understanding of terms and
            concepts which will translate to doable and concrete steps at each stage of the project cycle to
            ensure that gender equality gaps are addressed.
            Applicable to both spatial and socioeconomic gender-responsive planning, programming,
            and monitoring and evaluation, these guidelines will enhance the effectiveness of existing
            development guidelines at the national, regional, and local levels.
            We are very pleased with the potential that this document has to guide project managers and
            implementors. We look forward to these guidelines being consistently applied by NEDA, line
            agencies, local government units, donor agencies, and civil society organizations in the design,
            implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of their projects.
            As with the original version of the guidelines, we hope that the third edition of the
            Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines will help fast-track our collective efforts at
            making gender mainstreaming show concrete results in the quality of lives of women and men,
            girl and boy children.
