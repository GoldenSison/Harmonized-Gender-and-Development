            This revised set of guidelines was developed and produced by the National Economic
            and Development Authority (NEDA), in collaboration with the Philippine Commission
            on Women (PCW) and the Official Development Assistance–Gender and Development
            (ODA–GAD) Network. We would like to make special mention of the Network
            members involved in the development of the guidelines, particularly the Asian
            Development Bank (ADB), Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID),
            Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), European Commission (EC),
            International Labor Organization (ILO), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA),
            United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Development Programme
            (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United States Agency for
            International Development (USAID), the World Bank (WB), World Health Organization
            (WHO), and Voluntary Service Overseas Philippines (VSOP). The Government of Spain
            and Agencia Española de Cooperacion Internacional para el Desarrollo (AECID)
            provided funding support for the current reprinting of the third edition of the
            guidelines.
